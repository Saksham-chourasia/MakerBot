# 📸 Intelligent Vision-Based Monitoring System

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a Python-based intelligent monitoring system integrating computer vision, GUI control, and dataset management. The system supports camera handling, dataset processing, and structured JSON-based data workflows for real-time analysis and experimentation.

The architecture is modular and designed for extensibility, testing, and future integration with ML pipelines.
